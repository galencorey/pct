        <p> This project remembers, documents, and showcases Providence’s Chinatown and connects this history both to the modern Chinese diaspora in Rhode Island and to all of the state’s residents. This exhibition is part of a larger effort to create an
          archive of the Chinese American experience in Rhode Island. The archive will include relevant documents, images and objects for future scholarly and community research.</p>

        <h3>About Providence’s Chinatown’s Partners and Sponsors</h3>

        <p>The exhibition team works out of the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-humanities/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Nicholas Brown Center for Public Humanities and Cultural Heritage</a> at Brown University where Angela Feng
          and Julieanne Fontana, the lead exhibit curators, have energized a cohort of their fellow graduate students in Public Humanities to contribute a variety of talents. Supporting the front-line team are John Eng-Wong, Visiting Scholar, and Robert
          Lee, Associate Professor, both in American Studies at Brown.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://www.chsne.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chinese Historical Society of New England (CHSNE)</a> is a nonprofit entity incorporated in Massachusetts in 1992. It is the first educational organization dedicated solely to
          documenting, preserving, and promoting the history and legacy of Chinese immigration in New England.</p>
        <p>The <a href="http://sos.ri.gov/divisions/Civics-And-Education/archives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhode Island State Archives</a>, a part of the Rhode Island Department of State, is open to the public Monday through Friday, 8:30 to 4:30 at
          337 Westminster Street in downtown Providence. Validated parking is available adjacent to the building at Down City Parking.
